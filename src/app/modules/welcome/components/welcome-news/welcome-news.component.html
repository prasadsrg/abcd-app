  Uday (Nana Patekar), a criminal don, takes it upon himself to get his kindhearted sister, Sanjana (Katrina Kaif) married,
  but he is unsuccessful since no one wants to be associated with a crime family. Dr. Ghunghroo (Paresh Rawal) has also been
  trying to get his nephew, Rajiv (Akshay Kumar), married but due to his condition—the alliance must be with a purely decent
  family—he is also unsuccessful. When Rajiv jumps into a burning building to save Sanjana, he is smitten by her. Uday and
  Majnu (Anil Kapoor), Uday's brother gangster hatch a plan for an alliance with Dr. Ghunghroo. The plan works and Dr. Ghunghroo
  confirms the alliance, thinking that Uday is a very decent man. But when he is later told that Uday and Majnu are mobsters,
  he quickly takes his family and flees to Sun City, South Africa to escape. However, Majnu and Sanjana have come to Sun
  City as well. Rajiv meets Sanjana again and the two fall in love. Dr. Ghunghroo reconciles with Uday and Majnu and finally
  agrees to the alliance. Uday and Majnu invite a powerful don of the underworld, RDX (Feroz Khan) to the engagement. At
  the party, a girl named Ishika (Malika Sherawat) arrives, claiming to be Rajiv's childhood betrothed. Ishika is actually
  the sister-in-law of Dr.Ghunghroo whom Dr. Ghunghroo asked to come and try to break off the engagement. Ishika manages
  to do so, leaving Rajiv and Sanjana heartbroken. Dr. Ghunghroo reveals that he did this for Rajiv's mother, who had married
  into a crime family and was harassed and tortured, thus telling Dr. Ghunghroo to raise Rajiv away from crime when he was
  born. Dr. Ghunghroo decides he will agree to the marriage only if Uday and Majnu give up their life of crime. Rajiv and
  Sanjana do this by reawakening Uday's love for acting and encouraging Majnu to pursue his love for painting. With these
  things keeping them busy, Uday and Majnu have no time for crime any more. Rajiv's actions anger RDX's son, Lucky, who attempts
  to shoot Rajiv. Sanjana gets hold of the gun and fires a shot that hits Lucky, causing him to go unconscious. RDX is informed
  of his son's death and comes to attend the cremation. However Lucky, who is still alive, escapes, trying to show his father
  that he's actually alive. RDX sets the pile of wood on fire, believing he is cremating his son's body. However Lucky, who
  had been hiding under the wood, jumps out upon realising the wood is on fire, and the truth is revealed to RDX. Rajiv,
  Ghunghroo, his wife, Ishika, Uday, Majnu and Sanjana are captured by RDX and brought to a cabin set next to a cliff. The
  frightened group is forced to play Passing the Parcel (Hot Potato) with a globe—but the one who ends up with the globe
  must jump off the cliff. When Rajiv refuses to pass the globe to Sanjana, Lucky angrily yanks it out of his hands, just
  as the music stops. Now that his son has the globe, RDX figures the only way he can maintain his image is by killing everyone.
  Before he can, several government brokers sneak up and cut the footings of the cabin, causing the house to start falling
  over the cliff, with everyone trapped inside. However, the cabin is suspended by only one column. Hilarious chaos ensues
  as the group tries to balance the cabin together and keep it from falling off the cliff. Rajiv finds a rope and the group
  uses it to get back onto stable ground. But to everyone's shock, the floor breaks and Lucky is found hanging on the edge
  of the cabin. While Rajiv is trying to rescue him, Sanjana reveals the truth to everyone that she was the one who shot
  Lucky, but Rajiv blamed himself so that Sanjana wouldn't get in trouble. After Rajiv rescues Lucky, the cabin he is standing
  on falls off into the cliff. Sanjana keeps crying for him thinking he is dead. However, Rajiv survives the event and is
  reunited with Sanjana and his family. Lucky and RDX are grateful to Rajiv for saving their lives and RDX gives up his life
  of crime, allowing Rajiv and Sanjana to finally get married. However, when they realise the that Ishika fooled them alongwith
  Rajiv, as a part of his plan to marry Sanjana, they decide to kill him. But Rajiv ends up running away with Sanjana and
  Ishika with Majnu and Uday on the run after him.
