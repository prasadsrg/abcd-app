  Below is a list of all html tags with links to their page on this site, W3C.org and www.w3schools.com. W3C is the principle
  organization that sets standards for HTML. While I like what they are doing with HTML5, W3C's site is next to impossible
  to navigate and their language tangled at best. However, they are the powers that be. As a web designer you will eventually
  find yourself on their site. You may as well start now. I often use W3schools as a reference site, plus they have good
  intermediate level tutorials. In fact I recommend them as a good site to continue your studies after you have gotten the
  basics down here. !DOCTYPE a abbr address area article aside audio b base bdi bdo blockquote body br button canvas caption
